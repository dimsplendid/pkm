# Inbox Zero

An approach to email management that aims to keep the inbox empty. The **Zero** not only refers to "the number of emails in the inbox", but also refers to "the amount of time an employee's brain is in his inbox," according to the Inbox Zero Method's creator, Merlin Mann.

## Implementation

1. Unsubscribe to any marketing emails or newsletters you don't read.
2. Designate specific time for checking your email and clearing your inbox. Ideally, once in the morning and once in the evening
	> I think I would do this at the end of every 1 or 2 hours.
3. Change your email notification settings to eliminate the time-consuming distraction that comes with being notified of new emails throughout the day.

One of the goals of using Inbox Zero Method was to stop using email as a to-do list, Merlin Mann identified 4 possible actions he could take for each incoming email: **Delete, Delegate, Do, Defer**

- **Delete**: Does this email require action from you? Does it contain any information you might need to refer back to? If both answer is no, you can delete or archive the email right away.
- **Delegate**: Are you the correct person to address the ask in this email? Could someone else on your team respond more effectively than you? If yes, you can delegate by forwarding the email to the correct person. Then, archive or delete.
- **Do**: Does this email require action from you? Are you the correct person to respond to it? Can you respond very quickly(ideally in 3 sentences)? If the answer to all those questions is yes, respond to the email, then archive or delete it, and move on to the next message in your inbox.
- **Defer**: Will you need more time to respond to this email --- either because you need to follow up on a different day, type a longer response, or find files to attach? Does it contain information you may need to refer back to later? If the answer to either of those question is yes, sort this email into a separate folder, snooze it, or label it so you can come back to it later, after all your other emails have been touched.

> How about tracking the message? If I delete all of them, it just became hard to tracking the issue, isn't it?
