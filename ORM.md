# ORM

ORM(Object Relational Model) does would be to think of it as an excel spread sheet, with rows and columns. When using this set up, you want to be sure you have a great plan on how you want to tackle the current application, it does not allow as many modifications like [[ODM]] does.

Relation: connection between data
