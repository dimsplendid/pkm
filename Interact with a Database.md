title: Interact with a Database?

# Interact with a Database?

There are 2 common ways for interacting with a database:

1. Using the databases' native query language (e.g. SQL)
2. Using an Object Data Model ("[[ODM]]") or an Object Relational Model ([[ORM]]) represents the website's data as [[javascript|JS]] objects, which are then mapped to the underlying database.

> [!Tip]
> Using ODM/ORMs can result in lower costs for development and maintenance!
> > 深有所感，雖然目前只開發一些簡單的東西，不過做了 raw -> database, database -> calculation, 可以減少很多問題。

> [!Info]
>  Now using [[Django ORM]] is pretty good to handle most of things
