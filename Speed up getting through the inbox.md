# Speed up Getting Through the Inbox

The tips to get through emails fast when using [[Inbox Zero]] Method.

## 1. Trash the Folders

Labeling emails or dragging them into folders may feel orderly and satisfying.

But when you get more and more emails, you should waste time thinking and ordering what this mail should refer to. Worse than worse, the "organized" structure is hard to find the email because you need to think about where the mail is again and it would locate somewhere you have already forgotten the reason. In the end, the fastest way is just to search all the emails.

## 3. Process Your Inbox Once or Twice per Day

Set aside specific time for email.

## 4. Archive Your Backlog

Archive everything older than your use-by date.

## 5. Don't Mark as Unread, Archive Instead

Archive emails when done, and see your inbox itself as things to do.

## 6. Automate Triage

Group emails by type. If you reply to emails in the order they appear, your brain constantly changes gears. You flick back and forth between projects, alternate between brief acknowledgements and in-depth replies, and flip from updating your team to replying to mom.

This is task-switching and it costs you valuable time.

## 7. Set Reminders to Follow up

You're sending crucial email: closing deals, meeting deadlines, or landing meetings.

So what do you do? Perhaps you keep everything in your head, or use another tool to painstakingly track your to-do list.

Instead, set reminders. You will avoid this extra work, and dramatically speed yourself up.

## 8. Create Meaningful Templates

Think about the most common requests you get via email.

Are they pitches, introductions, or messages from recruiters? What are the phrases you find yourself typing again and again? Capture this wording to use an reuse.

It takes time to craft emails that strike the right tone, and that's where templates come in. Create a template once, then use it hundreds of times. Even when you're pressed for time, you can summon the perfect words --- informative, thoughtful, and typo-free.

## 9. Schedule Your Messages

Send hundreds of emails, and you'll get hundreds of emails in return. Your inbox like the mythical Hydra: chop one head off, and several sprout in its place!

Unless the recipient is urgently waiting, schedule your send:

Time delivery to suit the recipient's work hours or time zone. If their notifications are on, you'll spare them out-of-hours interruptions. And most importantly, **you won't get an instant reply that tempts you back into a thread!**
