# Speed up Getting Through the Inbox

The tips to get through emails fast when using [[Inbox Zero]] Method.

## 1. Trash the Folders

Labeling emails or dragging them into folders may feel orderly and satisfying.

But when you get more and more emails, you should waste time thinking and ordering what this mail should refer to. Worse than worse, the "organized" structure is hard to find the email because you need to think about where the mail is again and it would locate somewhere you have already forgotten the reason. In the end, the fastest way is just to search all the emails.

## 2. Use Keyboard Shortcuts
