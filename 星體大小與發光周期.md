# 星體大小與發光周期

記得好像有提到過這個，然後和光速有關

The first sign of such emissions from a binary system with a black hole came shortly after the launch of the Uhuru X-ray–detecting satellite in 1971. Astronomers became intrigued with an X-ray source designated Cygnus X-1. This source is quite unlike pulsating X-ray sources, which emit regular bursts of X rays every few seconds (see Section 21-8). Instead, the X-ray emissions from Cygnus X-1 are highly variable and irregular; they flicker on time scales as short as one-hundredth of a second. One of the fundamental concepts in physics is that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (recall Section 22-1). Because of this limitation, an object cannot flicker faster than the time required for light to travel across the object. Because light travels 3000 km in a hundredth of a second, Cygnus X-1 can be no more than 3000 km across, or about a quarter the size of the Earth.

不規則、快速地閃爍，代表能量是在很小的範圍內產生，因此可以決定星體的最大大小。
