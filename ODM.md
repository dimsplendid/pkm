# ODM

ref: [What is the difference between ODM and ORM? | by Juliana Tyler | Medium](https://medium.com/@julianam.tyler/what-is-the-difference-between-odm-and-orm-267bbb7778b0)
ODM(Object Data Model) we can add new fields and properties easily but with ORM when adding a new field you need to keep in mind that nothing stays empty so it needs a value to be as default unless you want to go into each and modify.
