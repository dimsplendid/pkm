# MathJax

Using JavaScript to render math equation on HTML in latex math format. And more and more markdown editor support this feature(HackMD, obsidian, and also GitHub).

Although MathJax may not support all packages, most of the equation still work fine. One of my favorite is `mhchem` which can render chemical formula. And this package also support a little goodie for **units**: `\pu{}`

$$
\pu{123 J*s}
$$
$$
\pu{1.23E3 J/s}
$$
$$
\pu{1.1E3 m2s-1}
$$

Fantasy!
