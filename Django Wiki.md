# Django Wiki

The [[Django]] plugin that build a simple wiki pages, using [[markdown|Markdown]] as content.

Although this seems good enough for me, the markdown extension seems hard to expand, some functions like **formula**, **admonitions** is hard to display(yea, I can still using html, which is good for now). And the most uncomfortable thing is I can't record using git. Maybe the [[mkdocs]] is a good replacement?
