# Git

1. download code from repository

```bash
git pull
```

2. upload code to repository

```bash
git push
```

3. commit: save changing code to git, see more in [[How to commit message]]

```bash
git add new_files # or using `git add .`
git commit -a # Using a vi-like editor to write more information
```

4. Watch the commit log, and this is why we should put good commit messages
