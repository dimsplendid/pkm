# Cauchy's Equation

It's a **empirical relationship** between the refractive index and wavelength.

$$
n(\lambda) = A + \frac{B}{\lambda^2} + \frac{C}{\lambda^4} + ...,
$$

Usually, it is sufficient to use a two-term form of the equation.

$$
n(\lambda) = A + \frac{B}{\lambda^2}
$$
and A, B can simply get by 2 experiment $n$ value
$$
\begin{align*}
A &= \frac{n_2\lambda_2^2-n_1\lambda_1^2}{\lambda_2^2-\lambda_1^2} \\
B &= \frac{(n_1-n_2)\lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2}{\lambda_2^2-\lambda_1^2} 
\end{align*}
$$
