# Introduction Myself

Nice to meet you, my name is Tseng Wei-Hsiang. You can just call me by my English name, Andrew.

I'm graduated from National Taiwan University with the master's degree in Chemistry.

I have been with Innolux for 5 years and work as a technology development engineer.

I'm responsible for testing the new LCD materials, such as liquid crystal, polyimide and seal.

The main testing items are optical, reliability and to find the proper production conditions. And we also need to solve the issues from the customers. 

Because of these experience, I'm truly passionate about developing new liquid crystal with Merck.

## Interests

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading novel, watching anime and camping.

## Graduated

My master's job is about thermal quantum dynamics simulation. I simulate the energy transfer network of the plant's PSII system. And try to find the energy transfer path by network searching algorithm.
