# Introduction Myself

Nice to meet you, my name is Tseng Wei-Hsiang. You can just call me by my English name, Andrew.

I'm graduated from National Taiwan University with the master's degree in Chemistry.

I have been with Innolux for 5 years and work as a technology development engineer.

I'm responsible for testing new LCD materials such as LC, PI and seal.


## Interests

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading novel, watching anime and camping.
