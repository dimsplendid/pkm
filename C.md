# C

I have read Learn C in the hard way, but it's not enough, I'm curious what's the modern C development?

1. Software package manager? There are `pip` in python, `npm` in JS, `gem` in Ruby, what about C?
	> [Welcome to Conan C/C++ Package Manager Documentation â€” conan 1.47.0 documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/)
2. What about virtual environment?

> [!Note]
> 1. C is not like python, most feature has backward compatibility. So the environment is more reliable, but I think we can always make a docker. Let me see later.

> [!Info]
> I would re-learn follow the book, [[Modern C (Jens Gustedt) (z-lib.org).pdf|Modern C]], in C17 standard.

3. What about deploy? I know it's simple to compile and execute, but how to solve environment and platform problem?
4. What's the best coding layout?
5. Review the naming conventions.
6. OO and design pattern implementation?
7. Build a full-stack web server using C
	> See how jserv do.

> [!Info]
> Try dataview to print the list from the [[C kanban|kanban]]?
