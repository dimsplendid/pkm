# C

I have read Learn C in the hard way, but it's not enough, I'm curious what's the modern C development?

1. Software package manager? There are pip in python, npm in JS, gem in Ruby, what about C?
	> [Welcome to Conan C/C++ Package Manager Documentation â€” conan 1.47.0 documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/)
2. What about virtual environment?
3. What about deploy? I know it's simple to compile and execute, but how to solve environment and platform problem?
4. What's the best coding layout?
5. Review the naming conventions.
6. OO and design pattern implementation?
7. Build a full-stack web server using C
