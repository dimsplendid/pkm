# Interactive App

## Objective
Make a dash board like page, which
1. Can edit, filter and show data immediately.
2. Can simply download the results.

## Need
1. Combine Django with JavaScript: [[Organizing your Front-End Codebase in a Django Project]]
2. Choose a frontend: React, Vue.js, Angular?
 > [!Note]
>  though there is an interesting way to implement interactive app without writing JS, it's just for simple task. And I want to do a more complicate jobs in the future.
